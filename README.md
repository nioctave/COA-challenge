# COA Take Home Challenge

## Summary
This project involves building an interactive photo gallery based on provided Figma designs and completing two JavaScript coding challenges. The goal is to assess my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and problem-solving.

## Project Requirements
- *Interactive Photo Gallery*: Implemented with responsive design and hover interactions.
- *Coding Challenges*: Two JavaScript challenges focusing on array and string transformations.
## Approach

### Interactive Photo Gallery
- *Responsive Design*: I will utilize CSS Flexbox and media queries to ensure the gallery is responsive across different devices.
- *Hover Interactions*: I will implement hover effects using CSS transitions to display additional details when a user hovers over a photo.
- *Figma Design Accuracy*: I will match the provided Figma designs accurately in terms of layout, spacing, typography, and visual styles.
- *Code Quality*: I will maintain clean, readable, and well-structured code adhering to best practices and coding standards.

### Coding Challenges
- *Array Transformation*: I will develop an algorithm to transform an array based on specific conditions.
- *String Transformation*: I will create a function to transform a string based on the length's divisibility criteria.

This approach ensures the project meets the specified requirements while maintaining high standards of code quality and functionality.
